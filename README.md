# JavaScript Grammar & Types – Practice

This repository contains a set of practical exercises based on the MDN
**JavaScript Grammar and Types** guide.

## 🎯 Goal

Refresh and deepen understanding of JavaScript fundamentals:

- variable scope (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- data types and literals
- type coercion
- primitives vs objects
- edge cases and JavaScript gotchas

## 📚 Source

MDN Web Docs – Grammar and Types

## 🧪 Structure

Each folder contains:

- a focused task
- a short README explaining the goal
- a JavaScript file with examples and explanations

## 🚀 How to run

```bash
node src/01-scope/scope.js
```

## 📝 Notes

This is not a tutorial project — it is a deliberate practice repo
focused on understanding JavaScript behavior under the hood.
